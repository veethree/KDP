# KDP
KDP is entirely **k**eyboard **d**riven **p**ixel art editor. It's a bit of an experiment. When i'm coding i use vscode with a vim emulator extension, So i pretty much never use the mouse. And i was curious if such an approach might work for pixel art. *Curiously*, There's not a whole lot of code driven pixel art editors out there so i decided to make my own.
