# KDP
KDP is entirely **k**eyboard **d**riven **p**ixel art editor.

# Why?
As a bit of an experiment. When i'm coding, I use vscode with a vim emulator extension, Or occasionally just vim. So my programming workflow is almost entirely keyboard driven. I was curious if such an approach might work for pixelart. *Curiously* there's not a whole lot of keyboard driven pixel art editors out there so i had to make my own.

# How does it work?
The way it works is *inspired* by my vim and vscode workflow. You have a selection of commands which you access with keystrokes & a built in command palette of sorts. The basics are as follows:
* Arrow keys to move your cursor
* d to draw
* x to erase
* f to fill
* s to enter select mode
* g to enter grab mode (while in select mode)
* if you hold down "c" and use the arrow keys you navigate the color palette
Then theres a bunch of commands to speed up navigating around your image. Heres a few of them
* If you type "ww" followed by an arrow key, Your cursor will warp to the edge
